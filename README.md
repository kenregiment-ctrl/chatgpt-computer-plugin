# ChatGPT Computer Plugin

Thin MCP adapter for `heidi-dang/computer`. CPTR remains responsible for execution, persistence, authentication, autonomous supervision, verification, retries, approvals, and restart recovery. This repository only exposes the ChatGPT-facing MCP tools and forwards scoped requests to CPTR's `/api/control/v1` API.

The first pass intentionally has no widget. The MCP connection may end while CPTR continues the server-side autonomous monitor.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `CPTR_BASE_URL` to the CPTR origin and `CPTR_API_TOKEN` to a scoped CPTR bearer token. The token must be authorized by CPTR; the plugin is not trusted merely because ChatGPT called it.

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run dev
```

The MCP endpoint is `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/mcp` and health is `/health`.

## Tools

The adapter provides workspace-discovery tools plus eight **direct-coding tools**: `cptr_code_list_files`, `cptr_code_read_file`, `cptr_code_search_files`, `cptr_code_write_file`, `cptr_code_edit_file`, `cptr_code_run_command`, `cptr_code_get_command`, and `cptr_code_cancel_command`. These let the official ChatGPT app independently inspect, edit, test, and iterate inside an authorized CPTR workspace without creating a CPTR task, selecting a CPTR model, or invoking CPTR’s agent loop. The adapter also provides `cptr_start_task`, `cptr_execute_task`, autonomous-monitor tools, task-status tools, and `cptr_get_diff` for the separate CPTR-agent workflow. `cptr_execute_task` starts a scoped CPTR task and waits for at most 60 seconds before returning either its bounded result or the durable task ID for follow-up. `cptr_monitor_autonomous` only creates a durable CPTR supervisor; the dedicated autonomous tools inspect, steer, cancel, and approve it without keeping an endless polling loop in MCP.

Tool schemas are bounded with Zod and each tool declares read/write/destructive annotations. Annotations guide client behavior but do not replace CPTR authentication or authorization.

## Official MCP shape

This server follows the current OpenAI Apps SDK guidance: the official TypeScript MCP SDK, Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, explicit input/output schemas, and tool annotations. The closest official no-widget-compatible example is the Node MCP Apps server in `openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples`; this project does not register UI resources in the initial pass.

For local inspection, run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest`, select Streamable HTTP, and enter the configured `/mcp` URL. In ChatGPT Developer Mode, expose the endpoint through an HTTPS tunnel or deployment, add the `/mcp` URL as a connector, and refresh the connector after tool/schema changes.

## Security and limitations

- The CPTR token is read from the environment and is never returned in tool results or normalized errors.
- The direct-coding tools are not CPTR agent delegation. They are scoped CPTR workspace primitives that the official ChatGPT app may chain autonomously: list, read, search, write, exact edit, run command, inspect command output, and cancel command. They require no CPTR `model_id` and no external OpenAI API key.
- Direct coding is confined to the selected owned workspace. It rejects absolute/traversal paths, environment files, binary/oversized reads, ambiguous edits, and destructive commands. A potentially external command requires both explicit user approval through `allow_network=true` and CPTR’s separate `command:external` scope.
- CPTR enforces workspace ownership and scopes such as `workspace:read`, `task:read`, `task:write`, `autonomous:run`, `git:read`, `coding:read`, `coding:write`, and `command:execute`. Existing tokens must be reissued with the three direct-coding scopes before these tools will work; `command:external` is intentionally not included in default newly issued keys.
- This adapter does not grant `git:write` or `deploy:write`.
- External/destructive autonomous assignments pause in CPTR with a durable approval record; the MCP `cptr_approve_autonomous` tool only forwards the scoped decision and cannot bypass CPTR policy.
- No widget is included yet.
- CPTR inherits its host-level security model; do not expose it to untrusted users without an appropriate authentication and network boundary.
